# 🧑‍💻 React Project Guidelines for Beginners

Welcome to the project! This guide is here to help beginner developers understand **which files to work with**, **what to change**, and **what to avoid** — so you can contribute with confidence! 💪

---

## ✅ Files You SHOULD Edit

### 1. `src/App.js`
This is the **main component** of the app. It’s safe (and encouraged!) to:

- Add your own components
- Display text, buttons, images, etc.
- Practice using `useState`, `useEffect`, and props
- Import components from the `components/` folder

📌 *Think of this as your main workspace.*

---

### 2. `src/App.css`
This is where you can add styles (colors, fonts, layout) for your app.

✅ You can:
- Change the background color
- Style headings and buttons
- Add classes and update their look

---

### 3. `src/components/`
This folder is for reusable pieces of UI like buttons, cards, and navbars.

✅ You can:
- Create new components (`MyButton.js`, `Card.js`, etc.)
- Edit existing ones to update how they look or behave

📦 Tip: Keep each component focused and reusable.

---

### 4. `src/pages/` 
This is where full-page components go (like Home, About, Contact).

✅ You can:
- Create or edit full views of the site
- Use components from the `components/` folder

---

## ⚠️ Files You Should NOT Edit (Yet)

### ❌ `src/index.js`
This is the **entry point** of the app. It tells React where to render your app on the page.

🚫 Don’t change this unless you’re:
- Adding routing (`BrowserRouter`)
- Using context (`Context.Provider`)
- Setting up Redux

---

### ❌ `public/index.html`
This is the HTML file React renders into — but React handles most of it for you.

🚫 Don’t edit this unless you're:
- Changing the website title or favicon
- Adding global fonts or meta tags

---

### ❌ `node_modules/`, `.git`, `package-lock.json`
These are managed by your system or npm. Don’t touch them manually.

## 🧠 Quick Tips for Beginners

- 🧼 Keep your code clean and well-indented
- 📁 Organize components and pages clearly
- 💬 Leave comments to explain what your code does
- 🔄 Commit often and write meaningful messages
- 📄 Use `README.md` files in folders to explain what they're for

---

By following these guidelines, you'll avoid breaking important parts of the app and focus on building features with confidence. You've got this! 🚀
